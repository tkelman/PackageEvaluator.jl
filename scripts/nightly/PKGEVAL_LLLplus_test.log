tests with small matrices...
...done

In all the following tests, the first time includes the JIT compilation; 
for the second execution the compilation is already done and the time
should be faster.

Error Rate is 0.0. It should be zero or very small.

Testing now with 200x200 matrix from latticechallenge.org.
All the column norms should be 30.
max col-norm of input is 233.24879420910196

max col-norm of lll-reduced basis is 30.0
  7.496027 seconds (28.18 M allocations: 4.016 GB, 3.64% gc time)
max column norm of seysen-reduced basis is 30.0
